# Calendar-GUI-using-python
Python defines an inbuilt module calendar that handles operations related to the calendar. The calendar module allows output calendars like the program and provides additional useful functions related to the calendar. 
Functions and classes defined in the Calendar module use an idealized calendar, the current Gregorian calendar extended indefinitely in both directions.
Along with the calendar module, we’ll also use the Tkinter module for the GUI of the calendar. I’ll take you through the code line by line for a better understanding of every line of the code.
You have to import two module i.e., Calendar module and tkinter module.
